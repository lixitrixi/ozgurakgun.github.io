I was the chair of [ModRef 2017](https://ozgurakgun.github.io/ModRef2017/).

ModRef is a long running workshop, typically colocated with the main Constraint Programming (CP) conference.
The main topic of the workshop is "Constraint Modelling and Reformulation", and this year it was the 16th of the series!

We had chaired [ModRef 2015](/activity/2015-08-31-ModRef2015) together with Peter Nightingale two years ago as well.
