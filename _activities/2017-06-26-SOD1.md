We are organising a ["Summer of Data" event series](http://www.idir.st-andrews.ac.uk/summer-data/), aiming to bring together people doing data-intensive research.

This is in the context of [St Andrews Institute for Data-Intensive Research (IDIR)](http://www.idir.st-andrews.ac.uk).

The [first meeting](http://www.idir.st-andrews.ac.uk/event-summer-data-2017/) was on the 26th of June. You can find the schedule on the IDIR website [here](http://www.idir.st-andrews.ac.uk/event-summer-data-2017/).

Here are [some tweets](https://twitter.com/ozgurakgun/status/879310022576132096) from myself during the event.
