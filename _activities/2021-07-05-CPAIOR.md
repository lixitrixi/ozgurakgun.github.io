The 18th International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research was held in Vienna (and hybrid online, due to the Covid pandemic) between 5-8 July 2021.

We published our work on "Finding subgraphs with side constraints" at the event, a recording of the talk by Ciaran McCreesh can be seen here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7vN4JUGj9o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7vN4JUGj9o)
