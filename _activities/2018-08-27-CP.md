The 24th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP 2018) will be held in Lille, France between August 27 and 31 this year.

We are happy to have 3 papers from our group accepted for presentation at CP 2018. Here they are.

- [Automatic Discovery and Exploitation of Promising Subproblems for Tabulation](/files/fulltext/2018/CP2018-Tabulation.pdf)
- [Metamorphic Testing of Constraint Solvers](/files/fulltext/2018/CP2018-Testing.pdf)
- [Automatic Generation and Selection of Streamlined Constraint Models via Monte Carlo Search on a Model Lattice](/files/fulltext/2018/CP2018-Streamlining.pdf)

In addition to presenting these papers, we will give a tutorial on [Conjure](http://conjure.readthedocs.io/en/latest/welcome.html) and [Savile Row](https://savilerow.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/). This will be a double act with Peter Nightingale, who is the main developer of Savile Row, and myself.

Moreover 3 of our PhD students (Gökberk Koçak, Saad Attieh and Patrick Spracklen) will attend the CP doctoral program. The doctoral program is a great opportunity for them to meet their peers, get feedback, and receive mentoring from a more senior member of the community. I had enjoyed attending to it at CP 2010 - 8 years ago already!

A preliminary program for CP 2018 is available [here](http://cp2018.a4cp.org/program.html).
