[Administrative Data Research Centre Scotland (ADRC-S)](https://adrn.ac.uk/about/research-centre-scotland) had the 2016 edition of its annual research meeting at the [New Lanark Hotel](http://www.newlanarkhotel.co.uk/).

I attended this meeting and gave a [talk](/files/2016/2016-09-27 Lanark Talk.pdf) there, highlighting some of our activities as part of this project so far.

The meeting was very useful for me as it allowed me to
appreciate the breadth of the project,
see progress of other project members,
and create valuable research links.
