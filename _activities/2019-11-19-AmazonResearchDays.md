I was invited to the Amazon Research Days event run by Amazon's Edinburgh office. It was interesting to see the industrial scale problems they are working on and the approaches they take for solving this problems.

One of the groups uses *data linkage* methods, similar to those we are working with some of my colleagues. Looking forward to possible collaboration opportunities with them!
