I attended "The UK Administrative Data Research Network Annual Research Conference 2017" in Edinburgh UK.
The website for the conference can be seen [here](http://www.adrn2017.net/).

One day before the conference we had the ADRN All Hands Meetings at the same venue as the conference.
Both the all hands meeting and the conference were very interesting.
See the conference website for the schedule of sessions.

We presented four papers in this conference.
