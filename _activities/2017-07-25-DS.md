I attended 2017 summer workshop of [Digitising Scotland](http://digitisingscotland.ac.uk/) at the Edinburgh bioQuarter.

This was a two day event, where on the first day the participants gave updates about their recent research.
I gave a talk on this day.
We had some really useful feedback and discussions after the talk.
I was also tasked to be the person responsible from tweeting, so here are [my tweets from the first day](https://twitter.com/ozgurakgun/status/889425438052945920).

The second day was structured as free-form discussion, which was extremely useful for getting more detailed feedback and making plans for the future. Digitising Scotland is a very multi-disciplinary project and these kind of meetings are very valuable to keep in moving (I think!). I didn't tweet as much during the second day, but [here](https://twitter.com/ozgurakgun/status/889766040015691777) is one.

There was also a [group photo](https://twitter.com/adrc_scotland/status/889804879971196928) taken as per tradition.
