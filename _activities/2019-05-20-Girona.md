We went to beautiful Girona for a combinatorial problem solving workshop. We had a chance to catch up with their recent research and vice versa. Our friends at Girona hosted us very well, see our happy faces [here](http://imae.udg.edu/recerca/lap/workshop-girona-standrews/index.html) as proof.

I gave a tutorial on using Essence and Conjure, which was good preparation to the summer school talk I will give soon as part of the ACP Summer School.
