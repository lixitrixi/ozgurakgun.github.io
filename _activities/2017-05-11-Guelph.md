I attended "The Workshop for the Systematic Linking of Historical Records" in Guelph, Canada.
The website for the workshop can be seen [here](http://recordlink.org).

I presented our work on using metric space similarity search and familial grouping to perform population reconstruction. The title was "Probabilistic linkage of Vital Event Records in Scotland using familial groups".
The abstract can be seen [here](/files/fulltext/2017/guelph-familial-groups-abstract.pdf).

Tom Dalton presented a paper with the title "Evaluating Data Linkage: Creating longitudinal synthetic data to provide ‘gold-standard’ linked data sets for comprehensive linkage evaluation", the abstract for this is available [here](/files/fulltext/2017/guelph-linkage-quality-abstract.pdf).
