We had one of our traditional away days at Rufflets Hotel, St Andrews. All staff is invited to these away days where we get a chance to discuss strategic matters with everybody's presence. I really enjoy these events because without them we are often dealing with urgent (and not always important) tasks, and the away day gives us an opportunity to take a step back and consider if there are any big changes we might want to make.
