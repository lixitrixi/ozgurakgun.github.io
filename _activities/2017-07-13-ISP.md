There is an international summer school that happens in St Andrews every year.
Students from several countries come and get a taster of Computer Science as well as other schools before they decide what they want to do at the university.

I talked to them about "Programs That Learn" - to give them a very broad idea of machine learning, data mining, and data science.
I gave some examples, both positive and negative.
I am intrigued by the negative examples: what happens when these algorithms go bad.
The students also seemed to enjoy these examples.

I gave them links to a number of online applications that they can play with at the end.

[Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ttosru126vdqcz4/programs-that-learn.pdf) are the slides.
