The 25th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming ([CP 2019](https://cp2019.a4cp.org)) was held in Stamford, CT, U.S. between September 30 and October 4 this year.

It's a long trip, and I have a 9-month old in my life to think about, so I decided not to attend this year's conference. My co-authors were kind enough to present the following papers though.

- [Automatic Streamlining for Constrained Optimisation](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-30048-7_22)
- [Instance generation via generator instances](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-30048-7_1)
- [Towards Improving Solution Dominance with Incomparability Conditions: A case-study using Generator Itemset Mining](https://modref.github.io/papers/ModRef2019_Towards%20Improving%20Solution%20Dominance%20with%20Incomparability%20Conditions%20A%20case-study%20using%20Generator%20Itemset%20Mining.pdf) (at [ModRef 2019](https://modref.github.io/ModRef2019.html))
