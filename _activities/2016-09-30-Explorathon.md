We presented our research on using Data Linkage for the automatic discovery of genealogies from historical vital event records at the [Explorathon '16](http://www.explorathon.co.uk/standrews) event.

The event was held at the fantastic [Byre Theatre](http://byretheatre.com/) in St Andrews to celebrate
[European Researchersâ€™ Night](http://ec.europa.eu/research/researchersnight/index_en.htm).

In addition to a [poster](/files/2016-09-30 Genealogy Discovery.pdf), we designed a card game involving vital event record for a small synthetically generated population.
The game helped us explain the problem and demonstrated the challenges we face.
