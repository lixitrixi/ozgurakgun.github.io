The 26th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming ([CP 2020](https://cp2020.a4cp.org)) was held between September 7 and 11 this year.

The conference was entire online due to the Covid pandemic.

I was involved in 4 papers that were published in this conference and the colocated workshops.
