We presented our research on using Data Linkage for the automatic discovery of genealogies from historical vital event records at the [SICSA DEMOfest 2016](http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/events/sicsa-demofest-2016/) event.

The event was held at the Technology and Innovation Centre, University of Strathclyde.

I mainly presented our poster titled [Large scale Genealogical Discovery using Data Linkage](https://twitter.com/ozgurakgun/status/797074210367688704).

I was also a collaborator to a second poster titled [An Automated Decision-making and Optimisation Pipeline](https://twitter.com/ozgurakgun/status/797080115108872194).
