The 27th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming ([CP 2021](https://cp2021.a4cp.org)) was held between 25-29 October this year.

The conference was entire online due to the Covid pandemic.

I was involved in 1 paper that was published in the colocated ModRef workshop.
