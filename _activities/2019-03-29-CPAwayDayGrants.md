We had a day with everybody in the CP research group at the Rufflets Hotel. This hotel seems to be convenient for these "away day style" meetings since it is close enough to St Andrews, has good meetings rooms and nice gardens...

The day was jokingly called a junket. I didn't know what the word junket meant turns out it means "an extravagant trip or celebration, in particular one enjoyed by government officials at public expense.". I can assure you our trip wasn't extravagant and there were no government officials involved. :)

We focused on brainstorming and then attempting to structure the several project ideas the group has. The day felt like a success on the day, but I guess the main test for whether it was successful or not will be the test of time. Let's see how many of the projects we planned will be written up and funded as successful research grants. Regardless of this, taking a break to think about what we want the future to look like was very helpful.
