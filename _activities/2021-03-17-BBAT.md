I gave a talk to *Bilgisayar Bilimleri Araştırma Topluluğu* (Turkish for Computer Science Research Society) on Constraint Programming. This was an introductory talk for a general Computer Science audience.

The talk was recorded, shared on the society's Youtube account: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0eFN6dcVRs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0eFN6dcVRs) (in Turkish).
