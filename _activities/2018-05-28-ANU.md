I visited Peter Christen and his group at the Australian National University in Canberra for week of the 28 May 2018.

Peter Christen works in the area of Data Linkage, and has literally wrote [the book](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642311635) on the subject. :)

During my visit I gave [a research talk](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/events/using-metric-space-indexing-complete-and-efficient-record-linkage) at ANU's Research School of Computer Science as well.
