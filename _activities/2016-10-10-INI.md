I visited the [Isaac Newton Institute](http://www.newton.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge between 10 October 2016 and 30 October 2016.

This visit was mainly to work together with [Prof Peter Christen](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~Peter.Christen/) on Data Linkage techniques. Peter has literally written [the book](http://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783642311635) on the subject.

The visit was funded by EPSRC grant no EP/K032208/1 and ADRC-S.
