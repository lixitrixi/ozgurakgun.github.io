I attended "[EWGLA 2018 - XXIV EURO Working Group on Locational Analysis Meeting 2018](http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/ewgla/)" in Edinburgh.

We presented our work on integrating electric buses into an existing network of carbon-fuelled buses, using Constraint Programming. We used data from Izmir, thanks collaborators Uğur Eliiyi and Deniz Türsel Eliiyi who had good connections with the local authorities. I hope this will be the start of a new line of collaborative work where we apply constraint programming to interesting and useful real problems.

It was also fun to work on something together with Emine. :)
