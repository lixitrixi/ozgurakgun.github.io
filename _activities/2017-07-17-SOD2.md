The [second meeting](http://www.idir.st-andrews.ac.uk/event2-summer-data-2017/) of the ["Summer of Data" event series](http://www.idir.st-andrews.ac.uk/summer-data/), aiming to bring together people doing data-intensive research, took place on the 17th of July.

This is in the context of [St Andrews Institute for Data-Intensive Research (IDIR)](http://www.idir.st-andrews.ac.uk).
