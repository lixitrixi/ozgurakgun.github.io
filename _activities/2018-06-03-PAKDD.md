I attended PAKDD 2018 "The 22nd Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining" in Melbourne, Australia.

This was between the 3rd and the 6th of June, 2018.

Here, I presented our paper entitled "Using Metric Space Indexing for Complete and Efficient Record Linkage".
This paper was co-authored with Al Dearle and Graham Kirby of University of St Andrews, and Peter Christen from the Australian National University.

[Here is a link to a Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ozgurakgun/status/1000605385953284097) including my tweets about travel, and the conference. I am not sure if all my Tweets during my visit to Australia can easily be found from this, but oh well.
