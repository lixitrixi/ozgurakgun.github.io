I gave a tutorial on the use of Essence and Conjure at the [2019 ACP Summer School](https://school.a4cp.org/summer2019/) in Vienna.

The organisers Andrea Rendl and Tommaso Urli did a great job. They even recorded some of the talks and an interview with all of the speakers. I believe they will publish these *real soon now*â„¢.

This was a great experience and I really enjoyed it. I had attended the [2011 edition of the same summer school](https://school.a4cp.org/summer2011/) and it was a great experience as a student then. I got to meet a lot of my peers and learned a lot. Also: [banana boat](https://school.a4cp.org/summer2011/photos/Joe/DSCN0400.jpg).
