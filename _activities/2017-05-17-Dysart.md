I went to Dysart Primary School in Kirkcaldy to present some Computer Science to the pupils.

After talking a little bit about Computer Science in general we focused on sorting algorithms.
We had prepared props in the form of laminated cards with numbers on them.
We started by trying to sort 8 cards by freely. The pupils formed groups of 4/5 to do this. 
Then we discussed how a computer might sort numbers, and then we tried to "execute" some sorting algorithms.

We managed to do bubble-sort and merge-sort with P3s and P4s.
We could only do bubble-sort with P1s and P2s.
But I think they all enjoyed the experience.
It was good fun!

Ruth Hoffmann helped me on the day and Ruth Letham organised the whole thing.
