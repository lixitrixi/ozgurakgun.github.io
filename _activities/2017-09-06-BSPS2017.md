I attended the [BSPS 2017](http://www.lse.ac.uk/socialPolicy/Researchcentresandgroups/BSPS/annualConference/2017-Conference/2017-Conference-Liverpool.aspx) British Society for Population Studies 2017 Conference in Liverpool.

Here I gave a talk with the title "Learning from past links: Understanding the limits of linkage quality", co-authored by Alan Dearle, Eilidh Garrett, and Graham Kirby.
You can find the abstract [here](/files/fulltext/2017/bsps2017-limits-of-linkage-abstract.pdf).
