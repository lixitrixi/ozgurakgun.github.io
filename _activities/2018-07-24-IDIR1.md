We are organising a series of summer workshops in the context of [St Andrews Institute for Data-Intensive Research (IDIR)](http://www.idir.st-andrews.ac.uk) again this year.

These workshops have been running for 3 years and they are getting stronger every  year.

This year we ran a [Well Sorted](https://www.well-sorted.org/) survey to collect ideas prior to the event. Then, we asked the respondents to help us categorise and group the responses into meaningful categories. This gave us a much better understanding of what people expected from these workshops.

The 3 themes that we came up with can be seen [here](http://www.idir.st-andrews.ac.uk/blog/2018/05/23/idir-summer-workshops-2018/).

We held the [first workshop](http://www.idir.st-andrews.ac.uk/blog/2018/05/23/idir-summer-workshop-2/) on the 24th of July. It was very well attended and all of the talks were very interesting. It is good to hear from our colleagues from other schools and their data-driven research.

We also received a contribution of Â£1000 from SICSA towards these workshops, which is helping us to provide lunches to all of the participants and to cover the travel costs of some of our invited speakers.
