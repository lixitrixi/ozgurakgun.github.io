I attended the [Data Linkage Scotland Showcase 2016](http://www.farrinstitute.org/events-courses/event/data-linkage-scotland-showcase-2016) organised by the following 3 institutions.

- [The Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research Scotland](http://www.farrinstitute.org)
- [Administrative Data Research Centre for Scotland](https://adrn.ac.uk/about/research-centre-scotland)
- [Urban Big Data Centre](http://ubdc.ac.uk/)

I will be presenting a poster (with Tom Dalton) as well as attending several talks during the day.
