Hi!

I am Özgür Akgün, and you've reached my personal homepage.

I am a Research Fellow at the School of Computer Science, University of St Andrews.

About

My main research interest is on automating the constraint modelling process. I am the main developer of a software tool called Conjure whose goal is to automatically produce Essence' constraint models to problems given in Essence. Essence is a very high level problem specification language. Essence' is a solver independent constraint modelling language. See Conjure's documentation for more information.

I am also interested in using Machine Learning techniques to solve real life problems.

I am currently employed on the ADRC-Scotland project, focusing on population reconstruction.

I was previously employed on the Working Together: Constraint Programming and Cloud Computing grant.

I did my PhD under the supervision of Ian Miguel and Chris Jefferson. We also have strong collaborations with Alan Frisch from University of York and Brahim Hnich from Izmir University of Economics. My studies were generously funded by The Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance (SICSA).

Prior to my studies in University of St. Andrews, I attended Izmir University of Economics to receive 2 B.Sc. degrees: Computer Enginnering and Industrial Systems Engineering. There, I have done courses on AI, OR and Heuristics amongst many others. We were lucky enough to present the results of our final project (together with 2 friends and our supervisor Mahmut Ali Gokce) at EURO-2009.

I received scholarships during my undergraduate education thanks to my success in the nation-wide university entrance exam in Turkey. I was at the top 0.62% amongst more than 1.5 million participants.

Activities

I reviewed papers in various years for top Computer Science conferences and workshops including AAAI, ECAI, CP, SARA, ModRef.
I was a chair of ModRef 2015: The Fourteenth International Workshop on Constraint Modelling and Reformulation.
I was a PC member of the Doctoral Program at CP2014 The 20th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming
