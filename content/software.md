I am involved in the development of some open source software.

(I will tidy this up later, but listing things briefly so I don't forget for now.)

Most significant is [Conjure](http://www.github.com/conjure-cp).

I contributed (a small bit, but I'd love to do more, not enough time!) to the compiler of the awesome dependently typed programming language [Idris](http://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev).

I contribute to [Savile Row](http://savilerow.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk) -- admittedly more often indirectly via making Peter Nightingale do a lot of (very cool!) work.

Etc..

My GitHub username is: [ozgurakgun](http://github.com/ozgurakgun).
There is also
[CSPLib]((http://github.com/csplib/csplib),
[DLRep]((http://github.com/dlrep/dlrep).
