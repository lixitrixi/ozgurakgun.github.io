We are starting a new Vertically Integrated Project.

The project is on the topic of using Artificial Intelligence for Decision Making.

In the School we already have a svery strong research group working in this area.

The group includes myself and my colleagues Ian Miguel, Ian Gent and Chris Jefferson, Joan Arxer, Nguyen Dang, Ruth Hoffmann, Andras Salamon and a few more people including PhD students and post doctoral researchers.

We have supervised projects at all levels in the past and we are now structuring this work under the umbrella of a VIP.

A VIP is vertically integrated because it includes students from multiple year groups and encourages students to be involved in a VIP for multiple years.

This way, students who have been involved in a project for multiple years can take a leadership role within the project.

Specifically for our VIP we would like to have second year, third year, fourth years and fifth year students.

We have developed and maintain a number of open source software projects, including Conjure which is the entry point of the pipeline of software tools.

Activity in this project will be divided into 2 strands: software engineering and the development of demonstrator applications.

In the software engineering strand, we are planning to use Rust and modern software development methods and tools to develop an efficient modelling toolkit.

In the demo strand, we are planning to develop web based applications that use our tools to show how they work on real life problems.

You can choose a strand depending on your interests and background.

We are happy to talk to you before you choose and we fully expect students to change strands throughout their involvement in the VIP.

Please get in touch if you are interested.


# Suggestions

1. Research the VIP and learn more about the work being done by the group. This will help you understand the scope of the project and the specific areas in which you might be able to contribute. Look at the publications by the staff members listed above. Some of these will be difficult to read for undergraduate students, do not worry if you cannot follow them. Try to get an overall feeling of the work. Look at the software projects Conjure, Savile Row, and Minion. You can start here: https://github.com/conjure-cp

2. Consider your interests and skills in software engineering and development of demonstrator applications. This will help you decide which strand of the project would be a good fit for you. You might want to look at [CSPLib](https://www.csplib.org) to get an idea of application domains.

3. Reach out to the VIP organizers and express your interest in getting involved. They may be able to answer any questions you have and provide more information about the project. Email: ozgur.akgun@st-andrews.ac.uk, include VIP in the title.

4. If you have any previous experience in software development or AI, be sure to highlight this in your communication with the VIP organizers.

5. If you are accepted into the VIP, be prepared to work hard and collaborate closely with the other members of the group. VIPs are a great opportunity to gain valuable experience and make meaningful contributions to ongoing research projects.
