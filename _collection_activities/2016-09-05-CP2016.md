I attended CP2016: "The 22nd International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming" in Toulouse, France.

We presented our paper
["Exploiting Short Supports for Improved Encoding of Arbitrary Constraints into SAT"](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=heG7k-gAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=heG7k-gAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC).

I also helped organise and run the [CSPLib Sprint](https://cp2016.sched.org/event/7XHS) event as part of this conference.
